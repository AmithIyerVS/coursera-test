			This Caribbean produce is massively exported to Japan. It has a beautiful bold taste and powerful kick of caffeine to keep you awake for hours. I tried this coffee for the first time when I visited Jamaica; I instantly love it!</div></div>

Good Turkish coffee should be made in a copper cezve (a small pot thatâ€™s used to simmer the coffee) to ensure the prime taste and quality of the coffee.The thick and frothy consistency of the coffee is delicious and something that you should try when you visit Turkey. The Turkish coffee is typically served with water to help cleanse your palate ready for the strong taste of the coffee.</div></div>

Colombian coffee has a respected reputation in the coffee industry; This is the third-largest type of coffee production in the world.
